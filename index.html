            "Once upon a time not so long ago </br>
            Tommy used to work on the docks, union's been on strike</br>
            He's down on his luck, it's tough, so tough</br>
            Gina works the diner all day working for her man</br>
            She brings home her pay, for love, for love</br>
            She says, we've got to hold on to what we've got</br>
            It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not</br>
            We've got each other and that's a lot for love</br>
            We'll give it a shot</br>
            Woah, we're half way there</br>
            Woah, livin' on a prayer</br>
            Take my hand, we'll make it I swear</br>
            Woah, livin' on a prayer</br>
            Tommy's got his six-string in hock</br>
            Now he's holding in what he used to make it talk</br>
            So tough, it's tough</br>
            Gina dreams of running away</br>
            When she cries in the night, Tommy whispers</br>
            Baby, it's okay, someday</br>
            We've got to hold on to what we've got</br>
            It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not</br>
            We've got each other and that's a lot for love</br>
            We'll give it a shot</br>
            Woah, we're half way there</br>
            Woah, livin' on a prayer</br>
            Take my hand, we'll make it I swear</br>
            Woah, livin' on a prayer</br>
            Livin' on a prayer</br>
            Oh, we've got to hold on, ready or not</br>
            You live for the fight when it's all that you've got</br>
            Woah, we're half way there</br>
            Woah, livin' on a prayer</br>
            Take my hand, we'll make it I swear</br>
            Woah, livin' on a prayer</br>
            Woah, we're half way there</br>
            Woah, livin' on a prayer</br>
            Take my hand, we'll make it I swear</br>
            Woah, livin' on a prayer</br>
            Woah, we're half way there</br>
            Woah, livin' on a prayer</br>
            Take my hand, we'll make it I swear</br>
            Woah, livin' on a prayer"</br>
